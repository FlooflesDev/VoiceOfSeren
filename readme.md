## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Voice of Seren copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/VoiceOfSeren/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Voice of Seren to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Features

- See the current Voice of Seren & vote in a consensus for the current voices
- Automatically contributes data as long as the app is open (can be minimized) when you are in Prif (can opt-out of automatic scanning)
- Active VoS are in Title Bar (exactly the same as D&D Notifications)
- Coming Soon: Be alerted when a favorited voice is active!
